# Pixel Agents — Compressed Reference

Pixel art office where AI agents (Claude Code terminals today, any tool tomorrow) become animated characters. Ships as a **VS Code extension** and an **`npx pixel-agents` standalone CLI** from the same source tree.

## Architecture

Strict layering: `core/` depends on nothing; `server/` depends only on `core/`; `webview-ui/` depends only on `core/`; `adapters/vscode/` depends on `core/` and `server/`. The standalone CLI never imports `adapters/vscode/` and vice versa.

Directory tree (derived from `ls`/`find`):
- `core/` — Protocol + interface definitions; `asyncapi.yaml` is the single source of truth for the wire protocol.
- `server/` — Lifecycle runtime + Fastify HTTP/WS server. Each CLI integration lives at `server/src/providers/hook/<id>/`.
- `adapters/vscode/` — VS Code surface; composes `core/` + `server/`.
- `webview-ui/` — React 19 + Canvas UI; depends only on `core/`.
- `e2e/` — Playwright suite (real VS Code + mock-claude).
- `scripts/` — `esbuild.js` (three bundles: extension, CLI, hook), `generate-messages.ts` (AsyncAPI → TS).

## Communication Flow

Hub-and-spoke. The server is the single aggregation point for all agent activity, regardless of source.

                                 (VS Code)      (standalone browser)
```

The VS Code adapter wires `PostMessageTransport` against `acquireVsCodeApi()`. The standalone CLI exposes the same protocol over WebSocket at `/ws` with the webview SPA served from the same Fastify instance. **The protocol shape is identical; only the wire differs.**

## Condensed Lessons

- `fs.watch` unreliable on Windows — always pair with polling backup.
- Partial line buffering essential for append-only file reads (carry unterminated lines).
- Delay `agentToolDone` 300 ms to prevent React batching from hiding brief active states.
- **Idle detection** has two signals: (1) `system` + `subtype: "turn_duration"` — reliable for tool-using turns (~98%), emitted once per completed turn. (2) Text-idle timer (`TEXT_IDLE_DELAY_MS = 5 s`) — for text-only turns. Only starts when `hadToolsInTurn` is false; suppressed once `hadToolsInTurn` becomes true. Reset on new user prompt or `turn_duration`. Cancelled by ANY new JSONL data.
- User prompt `content` can be string (text) or array (tool_results) — handle both.
- `/clear` creates a NEW JSONL file (old file just stops).
- `--output-format stream-json` needs non-TTY stdin — can't use with VS Code terminals.
- Hook-based IPC failed in early prototypes (hooks captured at startup, env vars don't propagate). HTTP `/api/hooks/:providerId` with `~/.pixel-agents/server.json` discovery works.
- PNG→SpriteData: pngjs for RGBA buffer, alpha threshold 2 (`PNG_ALPHA_THRESHOLD`), supports `#RRGGBBAA` semi-transparent pixels.
- OfficeCanvas selection changes are imperative (`editorState.selectedFurnitureUid`); must call `onEditorSelectionChange()` to trigger React re-render for toolbar.
- **External-session adoption**: scanner runs every 3 s. In hooks-OFF mode external scenarios, the test setup can race the first scanner tick. Mock-claude scenarios should give a few seconds of margin before assertions.
- **Heuristic sub-agent permission bubble timing**: the bubble lands 7 s after the SUB-TOOL is registered, not 7 s after the parent Task tool appears. Tests waiting on it from the "Subtask:" overlay need at least `1 s (Task→Bash gap) + 7 s timer + ~300 ms IPC/render = 9–10 s` budget.
- **runInBackground sub-character gate**: in webview `agentToolStart`, `runInBackground=true` Agent tools are gated out of sub-character creation when the parent has a `teamName` (teammate path handles it). With no `teamName`, the gate must be bypassed so the basic Subtask sub-character still renders. `addSubagent` dedups via `subagentIdMap`, so the bypass is safe even if a teammate is detected later.
- **Allure HTML report**: viewing via `file://` fails (browsers block `fetch()` from local files). Use `npx allure open allure-report/allure` or `npm run test:report:open`.

## Manual Hook Testing

`server/manual-hook-events.http` (REST-Client format) drives the local hook server while the extension is running. Copy `port` and `token` from `~/.pixel-agents/server.json`, set `cwd` to a workspace folder opened in the Extension Development Host. Covers `SessionStart` → `PreToolUse` → `PermissionRequest`/`Notification`/`Stop` → `SessionEnd`.

If `cwd` is outside the current workspace, enable **Watch All Sessions** first.

## Key Decisions

- **Four-package monorepo** with strict layering (core → server → adapters; core → webview-ui). Standalone CLI never imports `adapters/vscode/` and vice versa.
- **AsyncAPI 3.0 contract**, generated TS bindings, CI drift check. Single source of truth for the wire protocol.
- **AgentRuntime** shared lifecycle core, composed by both surfaces.
- **AgentStateStore** as single source of truth with typed mutations and typed events. No transport calls outside the broadcast layer.
- **Transport abstraction**: `MessageTransport` interface, `PostMessageTransport` + `WebSocketTransport`. One branching point in the entire UI.
- **HookProvider** as the integration boundary, with optional file fallback. New CLIs are a single subdirectory under `server/src/providers/hook/<id>/`.
- **TeamProvider** as optional extension. Claude Agent Teams is the only implementation.
- **Per-adapter namespaced persistence** under `~/.pixel-agents/`. VS Code and standalone never clobber each other.
- **Verify-before-clear migration** for legacy VS Code state.
- **Single `WebviewViewProvider`** (panel area, not editor area).
- **Inline esbuild problem matcher** (no extra extension needed).
- **`erasableSyntaxOnly`** in webview forbids `enum` — use `as const` objects.
- **Server always starts** regardless of hooks toggle. Only hook installation is gated by the setting.
- **E2E over webview unit tests** for OSS friction. Community PRs change webview internals constantly; unit tests would force contributors to update internals tests on top of feature work. E2E pins user-facing behavior, which is stable across internal refactors.
